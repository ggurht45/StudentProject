matrices can represent rotations. wow. mind blown.
[   cos(ang)  -sin(ang)
    sin(ang)    cos(ang ]
this matrix represents a rotation around the origin in 2D. given any point/vector or line.
or even shape probably. you can rotate it around the origin by any angle (Matrix)(point) = new point . note order of multip. matters.
see jmtPatrick: Rotation Matrices

wow. khan academy was very useful also. linear transformation. category theory popping up again. how is linearity defined by scaler multip and L(a+b) = La + Lb.
 it seem a weird way to define "linear" trans. could look into more later.
 other than that, the video was awesome "Rotations in R2 Khan academy"
