goals:

run proj.


interesting. right hand not showing. show both hands. maybe other in red color. 
understand time better. 
increase time or see it displayed. 



--------
it throws up, so you basically need to give it a throwup bag.

--------
what is displayLimit?

--------------------------------------------------
10 mins. 
5:35.1.2.3..
6:12.4.5  can load and display hand!^

----------------------------------------------------
create  new scene for loading section
have updatable algorithms. peace sign gesture -> set angles for last 3 fingers 
to be acceptable below a certain range. if that range gets overridden by clinician,
then update the acceptance criteria

--------------------------------------------------
8:23
make hand appear on new scene.   

-------------------------
left hands:
1,3,5, 6, 10, 11, 13,15, 16

//notes about goal
//i want no roll. high pitch. no yaw.
//so. i need to be able to correct* for having roll. having yaw(fingers pointing to right),
//having wrong pitch (fingers facing downwards or something)

x - //put a sphere on supersimple hand

//one by one. see at each step. and display each step.
//printInfo on group
//double cross product. one cross product is not enough. do one at a time and see results.



//i see how the pitch can be very large in the fingers pointing to right vector.
Pitch is the angle between the negative z-axis and the **projection** of the vector onto the y-z plane.


//maybe the problem is happening here. need to test this to make sure its behaving as i expect
this.getTransforms().addAll(rPitch, rYaw, rRollPN);


getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): YZ (0, 0.205163, -0.0832915) mag (weight): 0.22142547
getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): XZ (0.975177, 0, -0.0832915) mag (weight): 0.9787279
getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): XY (0.975177, 0.205163, 0) mag (weight): 0.9965252
//note interesting.. even though right hand only seems to do yaw. what we need to do to "UNDO" that is:
//key is how do i figure out these instructions (given below) from given info. that i can gather from the hand. *** look below
//2nd key is. if i do have 1,2, below, can I transform the hand gui as i wish. --> yes this test passes.
1. swing cc 90 in xy plane. (looking down -z axis(lm))--note -z is opposite in javafx
2. swing cc 90 in xz plane. (looking down -y axis(lm)) --note -y is opposite in javafx

*** could also multiply the weight by 90. and then would have to take care of the direction. cuz that number will always be +

hmm.. another thing   (note positive and neg are in terms of lm coord sys). Very important angles and projections notes below:
also see. "leap motion Vector java"
                        -- the angle is between (-zAxis) and projOnto_YZ (for pitch)  [jf csystem: +zAxis and projection]
                            -- +(0-pi) if angle is pointed up. -(0-pi) if pointed down
                        -- the angle is between (+yAxis) and projOnto_XY (for roll)   [jf csystem: -yAxis and projection]
                            -- +(0-pi) if angle is pointed to left of Y axis. -(0-pi) if pointed to right of Y axis

small method in view math to view node info.

moving functions from viewmath to debughelper


-try to get the real hands to behave like the supersimple hands.
    -wrap the hand in an entire group. and then can transform the hand, not the entire group ^^

-set up 3 buttons to set the positions easily. 6 buttons. 3 labels. labels read value of the angles.
    -need to parameterize the positioning method in the supersimple hand



--i really dont want to do ui. but i have to. so ^^ I will.

first small and easy goal to accomplish:

    * can listen to good song while doing that.

    -- make button clickable using script function.
    -- add material design to button
        -- make table on the left side, put button on the bottom, let the button execute on the text field.

            -done
    -- import controlsfx.
    -- should try to use trello or a command line tool that can talk to it


    --cleanup, run everything to see everthing is working.
            -- deleted local branches after pushing them up
    --set up the handlers for all buttons
    --store gesture info on hand
    --set up the table to show loaded hands.
    --fix the things mentioned in the email


    --cleanup branch, merge code onto it. perform cleanup. and merge back onto the setupTable branch

    -- allow for rotation on analyze scene.
    -- multiple saves of same gesture should take the latest gesture.
    -- cols showing comparison results
    -- make comparing method better


-----positioning hands
Given a node that is part of an active scene graph (i.e. displayed on the screen),
Bounds bounds = node.localToScreen(node.getBoundsInLocal());
will give the bounds of the node in screen coordinates. You can then call
getMinX(), getMaxX(), getWidth(), getMinY(), getMaxY(), and getHeight() is needed to position your dialog as required.

*(need to find a place on the hand, lets say palm position(pp), and subtract everything from it. <<--can write this up in the paper also

so (pp) will be high or low. like 10 or 3. we move it down to zero. so translate -10, or -3. <-- this translation will be a variable amount. depending on the pp
so a finger or a joint will be only moved down 3 or 10 also. hopefully this idea will work. (can test on analyze scene first)











    -- save current gesture, show its name in savebox label

    -- show notification if folder not found. alice for example.
    -- fix bug in 1.3 -> creating data and then closing app. doesn't successfully store data in .csv.
        -- it does. but because of the "saving on close operation" controller2 -> the saved data gets overridden.
        -- check if current scene is scene2. only then do the saving operation. or when new data gets entered, run update on controller2

    -- style savebox
    -- fix bug about folder appearing everytime we make new data

    -- comment out movebar --done
    -- by default should be named via counter value. -> can store in special object, property file. serializeble

    -- make sure hands dont move around

    -- if no folder was typed and "load csv was clicked", allow user to choose file from computer.
    -- show error dialog box if failed to load folder or wrong folder was typed in.

    -- put left-right into a setting icon opens a dialog
    -- make it so the save button opens in user's home directory
    -- think about how to keep data but refresh the class.
    -- attach "enter" event to save button --done
    -- fix bug about analyze button not showing up --done
    -- test with new file path saved.
    -- save gesture also





-----------------**
->i strongly desire to finish my project and do well on it.
->i am willing to say no to distractions and stay up as much as i can to work on it.
I will try my best to be happy when doing even the boring and uninteresting stuff for it.

************************************************
    --new idea to improve compare2:
    if one finger is off score should be multiplied by .1 or 0-> make it very easy to not pass the gesture if one finger is totally off
     if one finger is pretty close to good, then the finger score should be moved closer to 1 --> if in general fingers are good, should have an easy scale.

     --really need to get the log and linear scale to work well.
     --for thumb i could also consider just trying to use angles as previously done in compare1


     --why compare2 is better:
        --doesnt rely on target hand. allows for a more standardized results.
        --takes each gesture specifically and allows for parameterization (hopefully).
