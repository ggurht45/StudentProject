-should definately talk about -0.0f and how i figured out that the axis -> roll, pitch, were behaving very weirdly.

--there is definately a problem with the roll method. it returns 135 when it should return 45. need to subtract answer from pi. to get the correct answer.

--learning about transforms and how they get performed last to first. last transform added is the first to be performed
        //fix translate in superSimpleHandUI
        double transY = fingers.getTranslateY();
        fingers.getTransforms().add(new Translate(0, -6, 0)); // this transform happens first. transforms that get added last, are performed first
        //this below does not work. its hard setting the translate property.
//        fingers.setTranslateY(transY-6); //java coordinate system, y increases downwards. z into the screen, and x to the right.


-- vector cross product. a x b = fingers in direction of A, curl towards B, cross prod = thumb
