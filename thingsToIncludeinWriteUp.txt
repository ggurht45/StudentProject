-should definately talk about -0.0f and how i figured out that the axis -> roll, pitch, were behaving very weirdly.

--there is definately a problem with the roll method. it returns 135 when it should return 45. need to subtract answer from pi. to get the correct answer.

--learning about transforms and how they get performed last to first. last transform added is the first to be performed
        //fix translate in superSimpleHandUI
        double transY = fingers.getTranslateY();
        fingers.getTransforms().add(new Translate(0, -6, 0)); // this transform happens first. transforms that get added last, are performed first
        //this below does not work. its hard setting the translate property.
//        fingers.setTranslateY(transY-6); //java coordinate system, y increases downwards. z into the screen, and x to the right.


-- vector cross product. a x b = fingers in direction of A, curl towards B, cross prod = thumb

--matrix multiplication A = A3*A2*A1=Az*Ay*Ax = Aroll*Ayaw*Apitch Jose Pereda's blog leap motion

--    //epiphany. to get to 45, 45 x,-z handshake position.
      //i must add a rotation transform at the end. that basically does a rotation around the y-axis. a 90 yaw. -> flipping -90 yaw.
      //why? because order is always pitch then yaw, then roll. so if you want to do yaw before pitch, it must come seperately.^^

      so many things about rotations i had to learn by myself. if someone were there to explain them, it would have been so hard. it feels like i have been
      struggling in the dark for a long time.



-- things to remember. -weird coordinate systems. -0s in floating numbers and their effect on axises. -- wrong roll calculations in leapmotions. --flipping
angles of pitch and yaw to use method. --last transform that is added gets executed first in line.  --- rotations follow the order of Pitch first, then yaw,
then roll. if you miss this order or cant fit in something, then you need to execute it before by adding another transform.
