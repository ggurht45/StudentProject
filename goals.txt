goals:

run proj.


interesting. right hand not showing. show both hands. maybe other in red color. 
understand time better. 
increase time or see it displayed. 



--------
it throws up, so you basically need to give it a throwup bag.

--------
what is displayLimit?

--------------------------------------------------
10 mins. 
5:35.1.2.3..
6:12.4.5  can load and display hand!^

----------------------------------------------------
create  new scene for loading section
have updatable algorithms. peace sign gesture -> set angles for last 3 fingers 
to be acceptable below a certain range. if that range gets overridden by clinician,
then update the acceptance criteria

--------------------------------------------------
8:23
make hand appear on new scene.   

-------------------------
left hands:
1,3,5, 6, 10, 11, 13,15, 16

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


//notes about goal
//i want no roll. high pitch. no yaw.
//so. i need to be able to correct* for having roll. having yaw(fingers pointing to right),
//having wrong pitch (fingers facing downwards or something)

x - //put a sphere on supersimple hand

//one by one. see at each step. and display each step.
//printInfo on group
//double cross product. one cross product is not enough. do one at a time and see results.



//i see how the pitch can be very large in the fingers pointing to right vector.
Pitch is the angle between the negative z-axis and the **projection** of the vector onto the y-z plane.


//maybe the problem is happening here. need to test this to make sure its behaving as i expect
this.getTransforms().addAll(rPitch, rYaw, rRollPN);


getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): YZ (0, 0.205163, -0.0832915) mag (weight): 0.22142547
getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): XZ (0.975177, 0, -0.0832915) mag (weight): 0.9787279
getProjection(pitch:yz; yaw:xz; roll:xy): XY (0.975177, 0.205163, 0) mag (weight): 0.9965252
//note interesting.. even though right hand only seems to do yaw. what we need to do to "UNDO" that is:
//key is how do i figure out these instructions (given below) from given info. that i can gather from the hand. *** look below
//2nd key is. if i do have 1,2, below, can I transform the hand gui as i wish. --> yes this test passes.
1. swing cc 90 in xy plane. (looking down -z axis(lm))--note -z is opposite in javafx
2. swing cc 90 in xz plane. (looking down -y axis(lm)) --note -y is opposite in javafx

*** could also multiply the weight by 90. and then would have to take care of the direction. cuz that number will always be +

hmm.. another thing   (note positive and neg are in terms of lm coord sys). Very important angles and projections notes below:
also see. "leap motion Vector java"
                        -- the angle is between (-zAxis) and projOnto_YZ (for pitch)  [jf csystem: +zAxis and projection]
                            -- +(0-pi) if angle is pointed up. -(0-pi) if pointed down
                        -- the angle is between (+yAxis) and projOnto_XY (for roll)   [jf csystem: -yAxis and projection]
                            -- +(0-pi) if angle is pointed to left of Y axis. -(0-pi) if pointed to right of Y axis
                        -- the angle is between -zAxis) and projOnto_XZ (for yaw)    [jf csystem: +zAxis and projection]
                            -- +(0-pi) if angle is pointed to right of Z axis. -(0-pi) if pointed to left of Z axis

                            (right hand. weighted)

done -cap one boa
done -allyauto

small method in view math to view node info.
debug helper
moving functions from viewmath to debughelper


-try to get the real hands to behave like the supersimple hands.
    -wrap the hand in an entire group. and then can transform the hand, not the entire group ^^

-set up 3 buttons to set the positions easily. 6 buttons. 3 labels. labels read value of the angles.
    -need to parameterize the positioning method in the supersimple hand



--i really dont want to do ui. but i have to. so ^^ I will.

first small and easy goal to accomplish:
    --make a new file. add a button to it.
    --make the button clickable.
    -- style the button to look like material design.
    * can listen to good song while doing that.

    -- make button clickable using script function.
    -- add material design to button
        -- make table on the left side, put button on the bottom, let the button execute on the text field.
        -- add a vbox in the tab view and add a button to it from the code.
            -done
    -- import controlsfx.
    -- should try to use trello or a command line tool that can talk to it


    --cleanup, run everything to see everthing is working.
            -- deleted local branches after pushing them up
    --set up the handlers for all buttons
    --store gesture info on hand
    --set up the table to show loaded hands.
    --fix the things mentioned in the email


    --cleanup branch, merge code onto it. perform cleanup. and merge back onto the setupTable branch
